#About
```
  The term 'Memory Exploits' is a ficticious term that encompases a wide variety of exploitation
  techniques against vulnerabilities that, if exploited correcly, can results in taking control
  of program execution. They are mainly against program written in languages without explicit security.


  Going through these challenges is not enough. You will learn more by coming to the club meetings too.
