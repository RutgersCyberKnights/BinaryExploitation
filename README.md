```
  This repo is apart of the lessons of Rutgers Cyber Knights (R) . All challenges that are apart 
  of the first topic ( Memory Exploits) will be uploaded here.

#About
```
  The term 'Memory Exploits' is a ficticious term that encompases a wide variety of exploitation
  techniques against vulnerabilities that, if exploited correcly, can results in taking control
  of program execution. They are mainly against program written in languages without explicit security.
  
  Better terms would be "Overflows" or "Taking control of Program execution"

  Going through these challenges is not enough. You will learn more by coming to the club meetings too.
