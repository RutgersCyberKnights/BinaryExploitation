#The FBI has found a change in Evil's new authentication system


line 5:int authentication(char*password){
	int granted=0;
	char password_buffer[16];


everything else is believed to be the same

Hint:
	how does this change the stack?
	why can't you do what you did before?
	REMEMBER You need to analyze the memory to understand,
	or you'll be completely lost: GDB is your best friend


Helpful Tools:

	perl and python have power inline print functions
				MEGA IMPORTANT:
	address are 64bit [[[[[[little-endian format]]]]]]]]
		-example: \xaa\xbb\xcc\xdd -> \xdd\xcc\xbb\xaa
	

	perl: $(perl -e 'print "somthing"')
	python: $(python -c 'print("something")')

	such as ./cprogram $(perl -e 'print "something"x20 . lol')
	inputs long string :  somethingsomething...(18 more times)lol
	where . is concatenation	


	#perl is suggested#
