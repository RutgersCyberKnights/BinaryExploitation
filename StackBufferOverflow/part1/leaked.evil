# The FBI found leaked information on Evil's authentication system.
# This contains parts and information about the source code


line 5: int authentication(char * password){
	char password_buffer[16];
	int granted =0;
	strcpy(password_buffer,password);
	//hmm...there is no password? Strange...
	return granted;
	}

when authentication returns 0, access is denied


Helpful GDB:

	type:
		gdb authentication1 //enters gdb
		start (input)     //starts program at main line 1 with command line input		
		run  (input)   //runs whole program with input
		b (line number) //after run or continue, stops program at line X
		continue 	//continue program execution to next break point
		x (pointer or array)		// examine memory address
		x/Nx (pointer or array)		//examine N passed memory address in hex format
		disass main 	//disassemble main program tag into assembly
		x/i 		//examine address and print in decimal 
		*address (i.e. x *address) 	//treat hex as address
